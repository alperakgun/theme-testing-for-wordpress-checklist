Theme Unit Test

This step in Theme testing correlates to a WordPress export (WXR) file that you can import into a WordPress installation to test your Theme. To be clear, this is only one step in testing your Theme. See Theme testing for a full guide. 

Setup

WordPress Settings

Adjust WordPress settings as follows:

    Settings -> General: set the Site Title to something fairly long, and set the Tagline to something even longer. These settings will facilitate testing how the Theme handles these values.
    Settings -> Reading: set "Blog pages show at most" to 5. This setting will ensure that index/archive pagination is triggered.
    Settings -> Discussion: enable Threaded Comments, at least 3 levels deep. This setting will facilitate testing of Theme comment list styling.
    Settings -> Discussion: enable Break comments into pages, and set 5 comments per page. This setting will facilitate testing of Theme paginating link markup/styling.
    Settings -> Media: ensure that no values are set for max width or height of Embedded media. This setting will facilitate testing of the Theme $content_width setting/implementation.
    Settings -> Permalinks: ensure that a non-default permalink setting is selected, e.g. "Month and name". This setting will facilitate stepping through the Theme Unit Tests. 

Create at least two Custom Menus:

    Long Menu: all included Pages
    Short Menu: a menu of 2-3 Pages 

Template Hierarchy Index Pages

When viewing any Template Hierarchy Index page, including the default index page (index.php), and (if applicable) Blog Posts Index (home.php), Date Archives (archive.php), Category Archives (category.php), Tag Archives (tag.php), or Author Archives (author.php):

    Page navigation displays and works correctly.
    Debugger returns no PHP errors, warnings, or notices

Static Front Page

If the Theme includes either a front-page.php or a home.php template file, go to Dashboard -> Settings -> Reading, and set the Front Page to display a Static Page (use any existing Page), and set the Blog Posts index to another Static Page (e.g. "Lorem Ipsum").
